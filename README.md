# Reinforcement Learning : Solving Integer Programming

## Introduction
In this project I aimed to provide a solution for solving Integer Programming problems by learning to choose optimal gomory cuts (cutting plane problem) using reinforcement learning. Different hyperparameters and models were tested and the most optimum model was trained and its results have been showcased. This project was completed as part of the Reinforcement Learning course (IEOR 4575) at Columbia University.

## NOTE
* The code pertaining to training and testing of the model in the "Easy" configuration is present in the file named 'RL_Final_Project_Easy.ipynb'
* The code pertaining to training and testing of the model in the "Hard" configuration is present in the file named 'RL_Final_Project_Hard.ipynb'
